Migration
===

This will eventually become a document detailing migration plans for this website, in the event of a change of ownership/management, or in case of an untoward event.

Currently, the plan is just to contact Allan Berry and ask him what to do.  If he is hit by a bus, you'll just have to figure it out.  Maybe call his wife and see if she has any idea what his passwords are.

In the longer term, this is obviously suboptimal, and this document will be updated as more elegant solutions are implemented.

Thanks.
