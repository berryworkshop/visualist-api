# Getting running
On a development machine, run either the Django development server:
* `django_project/manage.py runserver`

...or the Heroku local environment, which mimics production:
* `heroku local`

The Django server will have niceties like debugging turned off.  The Heroku server mostly is to show whether things are correctly running for production.
