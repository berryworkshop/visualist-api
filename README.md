This program has been divided into three parts, each with a git installation.

* "api" is for Python (Flask) files and supporting libraries.
* "web" is for a static (Vue) frontend.
* "db" is for all database-related (Neo4J) files.
* Docs is for general documentation concerning these items.

No further stuff should be in this root folder, as it would be out of version control.  Thanks.
